This is my implementation of the assessment for ABN-Amro
See also the PDF file to read the requirements.

I used Android Studio Ladybug | 2024.2.1 - please use this version (or higher) to build and test it.

Github api has some limitations - I create an access key for this - that will expire in 30 days, after that this code will not work. 
Text are not translated only English interface for the moment - I could implement this, but for now this will do.
For the offline modus - I always fetch all the data, and store that in a room database. For this example this is overkill - storing the json to disk would also work - but I want to demonstrate my room database experience.
